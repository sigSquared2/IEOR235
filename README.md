The objective of our project is to implement a deep learning architecture that will receive a random street-level image from around the globe as input and then predict the country in which the image was taken as output. This idea was inspired by the game GeoGuessr (https://www.geoguessr.com/), where a human player is “dropped somewhere in the world in a street view panorama” with the mission of using clues to guess where they are on a world map.
